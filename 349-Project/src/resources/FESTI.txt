Festival Conference Center, or just Festival coloqiually, is a multi use 
building hosting a Food Court, many conference rooms, and even a rotation 
of Museum exhibits. The Festival Food Court is definitely the most popular 
location with a wide variety of selections all for just one punch. An always 
reliable hub for takeout food for late night study sessions or somewhat 
desperate dorm dwellers. Forever a favorite, even if some are shy to admit it.
