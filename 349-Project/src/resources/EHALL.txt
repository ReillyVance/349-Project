E-Hall is the ever reliable dining hall of East Campus. Renown for such traditions 
as Chicken Nugget Thursday and a very splendid and saving Brunch on the weekends. 
E-Hall makes a solid case against it's main campus counterpart for 
best dining halls on campus. So much so that even seniors will insist 
making a long journey from their apartments to their one true love.
