Rose library currently is the best (if only because of lack of choice) library 
on campus. A newer, modern styling compared to the old Carrier library 
it is host to a Starbucks location,the only coffee shop on East Campus. 
Meaning one must be aware of how much foot traffic is there at any given time.
