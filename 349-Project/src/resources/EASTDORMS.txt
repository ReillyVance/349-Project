Chandler, Chesapeake, and Shenandoah are the east side dorms. All bundled up next to eachother, 
each dorm still manages to carve a unique culture and experience from one another. These are some 
of the newer dorms, especially ones reserved for Freshman, making them a hot target by those who 
wish to avoid the business of Main campus life. Easily the best set of dorms if only because E-Hall 
is just accross the street when you need it the most.
