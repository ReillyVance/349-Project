The bookstore has many useful things ranging from a tech support area on the 
second floor and (potentially) any textbook you may need for your classes.
The first floor also has a ton of JMU merch if you want to really bleed
purple! Pretty much if you need any general supplies the bookstore and chip's
convenience (the small building right across the street) have all you'll need.
