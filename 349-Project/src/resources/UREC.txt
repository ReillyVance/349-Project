UREC is the go to spot for all things atheletic and energetic. 
The massive complex is home to state of the art facilities and machines 
including a comprehensive weight center, track, and an entire rock-climbing ward. 
The best part is that it is in the middle of a valley, 
so it truly is uphill bothways on the way home.
