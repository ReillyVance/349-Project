The union is home to 90% (I saw this number in a dream) of the clubs jmu
has to offer. There's also TDU on the basement floor that has a bunch
of pool tables that are free to use along with an arts and crafts workshop
on the second floor. Most importantly, this is where the campus post office
is located. If you live on campus, your mail will be found here.
